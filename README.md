Also, can someone tell me how to use git commands. i only know the git clone command (which i recently learned) and it hasn't been working. I type in: git clone https://github.com/PIKACHULOVER8/PIKACHULOVER8/blob/main/README.md  and it gives me: Cloning into 'README.md'...
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/PIKACHULOVER8/PIKACHULOVER8/blob/main/README.md/' not found
